# Elevator-Simulation
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/YosephKant/Elevator-Simulation/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/YosephKant/Elevator-Simulation)
Creates a simulation of a building with lots of floors and people on every floor trying to get to another floor. The elevator decides its logic of moving by choosing a direction. A direction is chosen either through a direction queue (formed by passengers getting on and pressing their destination button) or by the nearest button pressed on a floor. This simulation runs till every person has gone to where he needs or the ticks have ran out.
